# Blackjack
This is my mid python project:<br />
Card game whose object is to be dealt cards having a higher count than those of the dealer, up to but not exceeding 21.<br />
The project based on simulators (with no user inputs!) and prints the log of the game at the end of each round.<br />
This project was coded as OOP assignment on the 2nd semester of my 2st year Information Systems at College of Law & Business.<br />
